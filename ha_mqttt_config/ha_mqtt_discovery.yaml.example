# Note:
#   - Required fields MUST be present in the configuration.
#   - Optional fields MAY be deleted if not needed.
#   - If `generate_uuids` is "true", the script will automatically generate UUIDs to append to:
#       - Each component's `object_id` (used in the discovery topic).
#       - Each component's `unique_id` (used in the payload).
#       - Each device's `identifiers`.
#     The `object_id`, `unique_id`, and `identifiers` will be composed as: <value-from-this-file>-<uuid>
